Compiling xpdf
--------------

Xpdf is written in C++ (with a little bit of C).  It should work with
any ANSI-compliant C++ and C compilers.  The systems and compilers
it's been tested with are listed on the xpdf web page.

The following notes give specific instructions for compiling on
different systems.


*******************************
***  Linux, OS X, Freemint  ***
*******************************

* Make sure you have the following installed:

    - Make
    - FreeType 2.0.5 or newer
    - libpng (for pdftoppm and pdftohtml)
    - zlib (for pdftoppm and pdftohtml)

* Build:

      make

      Default destination folder will be xpdf_mint_release unless you set DESTDIR variable.

      For cross-compiling you can pass atgs to make as follow:

      CXX=m68k-atari-mint-g++ AR=m68k-atari-mint-ar RANLIB=m68k-atari-mint-ranlib make

  This will build binaries in:

      tools/bin/pdftops
      tools/bin/pdftotext
      tools/bin/pdftohtml
      tools/bin/pdfinfo
      tools/bin/pdffonts
      tools/bin/pdfdetach
      tools/bin/pdftoppm
      tools/bin/pdftopng
      tools/bin/pdfimages

And Headers plus libraries should be available in:

        usr/include/xpdf_mint:
            aconf.h
            aconf2.h
            fofi
            goo
            splash
            xpdf

        usr/lib:
            libfofi.a
            libgoo.a
            libsplash.a
            libxpdf.a
